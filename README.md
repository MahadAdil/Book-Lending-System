Book-Lending-System Written in C

Book-Lending-System is a small, basic program I coded with C, which has the ability to,
=> Add a new borrower's record 
=> Check if the person is an existing borrower(in this case new book is not issued until the previous one is returned) 
=> Find an existing borrower
=> Delete a borrower's record once the book is returned.

How do I run this on my Computer?
=> Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your computer
=> Download the source code
=> Compile the C code
=> Run the program

Cheers,
Mahad Adil
